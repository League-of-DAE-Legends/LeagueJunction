# LeagueJunction

Organisation tool for League Of DAE Legends tournaments. League of DAE Legends is a student club for students currently enrolled in the DAE ([Digital Arts & Entertainment](https://www.digitalartsandentertainment.be/)) curriculum, DAE veterans and ex-DAE students. As the name implies, this student club focuses on League of Legends. 

This tool is looking to automate the process from students registering to participate to making teams and all the way to tracking how players are performing to be able to forge a scoreboard.

In short, **LeagueJunction** has 3 topics:
- Balancing (Processing registrations and making reasonably balanced teams)
- Tournaments (Generating match keys through the Riot API)
- Personal progression (Database that keeps track of individual players their performance)
